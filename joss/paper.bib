    abstract = {Numerical models solving the full 2D shallow water equations (SWEs) have been increasingly used to simulate overland flows and better understand the transient flow dynamics of flash floods in a catchment. However, there still exists key challenges that have not yet been resolved for the development of fully dynamic overland flow models, related to 1) the difficulty of maintaining numerical stability and accuracy in the limit of disappearing water depth; and 2) inaccurate estimation of velocities and discharges on slopes as a result of strong nonlinearity of friction terms. This paper aims to tackle these key research challenges and present a new numerical scheme for accurately and efficiently modelling large-scale transient overland flows over complex terrains. The proposed scheme features a novel surface reconstruction method (SRM) to correctly compute slope source terms and maintain numerical stability at the small water depth condition, and a new implicit discretisation method to handle highly nonlinear friction terms. The resulting shallow water overland flow model is first validated against analytical and experimental test cases and then applied to simulate a hypothetic rainfall event on the 42 km2 Haltwhistle Burn, UK.},

    abstract = {Debris flow is one of the most common geohazards in mountainous regions, posing significant threats to people, property and infrastructure. Among different types of debris flows, runoff-generated debris flows are attributed to rain storms, which provide abundant runoff that entrain large quantities of bed material, resulting in the formation of a solid-liquid current known as a debris flow. One of the keys to effectively simulating runoff-generated debris flows is modelling the erosion-deposition process. The commonly used approach for formulating erosion and deposition, although constrained by physics, suffers from a singularity in the presence of vanishing velocity, which poses a major challenge for practical applications. It is also argued that the deposition rate cannot be represented by simply reversing the sign of the erosion rate. To address these two issues, we have developed a depth-averaged debris flow model with a novel method of calculating the erosion-deposition rate. We have demonstrated that the singularity is due to the non-linear erosion-deposition term but quickly disappears while the flow converges to the equilibrium that is defined by the classic Takahashi's formula. To resolve the non-linearity and avoid the singularity, an implicit method within a Godunov-type finite volume framework has been proposed. An additional parameter is introduced to differentiate the erosion rate from the deposition rate. The model is validated against several test cases, including a real-world debris flow event. Satisfactory results are obtained, demonstrating the model's simulation capability and potential for wider applications such as risk assessment and impact-based early warning.},

    abstract = {Flow-like landslides are one of the most catastrophic types of natural hazards due to their high velocity and long travel distance. They travel like fluid after initiation and mainly fall into the ‘flow' movement type in the updated Varnes classification (Hungr et al., 2014). In recent years, depth-averaged models have been widely reported to predict the velocity and run-out distance of flow-like landslides. However, most of the existing depth-averaged models present different shortcomings for application to real-world simulations. This paper presents a novel depth-averaged model featured with a set of new governing equations derived in a mathematically rigorous way based on the shallow flow assumption and Mohr-Coulomb rheology. Particularly, the new mathematical formulation takes into account the effects of vertical acceleration and curvature effects caused by complex terrain topographies. The model is derived on a global Cartesian coordinate system so that it is easy to apply in real-world applications. A Godunov-type finite volume method is implemented to numerically solve these new governing equations, together with a novel scheme proposed to discretise the friction source terms. The hydrostatic reconstruction approach is implemented and improved in the context of the new governing equations, providing well-balanced and non-negative numerical solutions for mass flows over complex domain topographies. The model is validated against several test cases, including a field-scale flow-like landslide. Satisfactory results are obtained, demonstrating the model's improved simulation capability and potential for wider applications.},
